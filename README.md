Harvard University CS50x Problem Set 2 Wordle in C 

This is my version of Wordle using C programming.
It was a week two problem set for Harvard University's CS50x Computer Science course.
    
    Note: the cs50.h library is specific for the course and is not useable outside of the CS50 Web version of VS Code. 
          However, the functions that are used can be built and swapped in.
